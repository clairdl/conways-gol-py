*[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)* (*Life*) is a cellular automaton created by John Conway. 

Maybe the most interesting feature of Life is that it is [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), meaning that it is equivalent to 
the computer that you're reading this on, in regards to how it can manipulate a set of abstract symbols (like 1's and 0's) according to a set of predefined rules.

This means that, although infeasible, it is theoretically possible to encode the state of our Universe and its and ruleset (quantum mechanics, general relativity, etc) in Life, 
and then start (simulating it)[https://xkcd.com/505/].
